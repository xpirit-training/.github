# Welcome

This organisation is a place with training contents and demos provided by Xebia | Xpirit.

Feel free to browse the repositories and find useful topics that help you improve your work and processes.

## How to Navigate

To make easier to search and find repositories we are following a naming convention which follows a kind of reverse notation.

_Demo_ repositories start with `demo-` in the name followed by the topic, such as, `actions-` oder `features-`.
